A Dataset is given which contains the details of customers like CreditScore, 
Geography, Gender, Age, Balance etc.

Problem Statement : We have to predict whether the cusomer will leave the bank
                                    or stay with the bank.

An ANN is trained with 70% of the given data in which 'Exited' is an dependent 
feature which we have to predict. If the value of 'Exited' is '1', it means customer
