Building an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Google 
stock price

Problem statement :
We are given Google stock price from 01/2012 to 12/2016. The task is to predict 
the trend of the stock price for 01/2017. Note that, the future variations of stock 
price are independent of the past. So, it is impossible to predict the exact stock 
price, but possible to predict and capture the upward and downward trends.
